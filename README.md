# Embracing Blue

http://embracing-blue.herokuapp.com/

This is the final group-project of our 9 week EDA journey. We had one week to build this.

The focus of this website is to provide mental health resources for those affected and their communities

We wanted to include the full stack (including auth) in a large-scale app

Some of the technologies used include JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Bulma, Express, Node, Knex, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, Enzyme, and Cypress

Our hopes are to help as many people as possible

Built by Mark, Priya, Theta, Sam, Hameet, and Annette

## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
yarn install
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run

```

  `yarn dev` for bundling, watch and nodemon

  `yarn start` only runs server (setup for heroku)


## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

`yarn run heroku:deploy` will push your local master branch to your heroku app

`yarn run heroku:migrate` will run your knex migrations on your deployed heroku app

`yarn run heroku:seed` will run your seeds on your deployed app

If ever you need to rollback, you can also just use `yarn run heroku:rollback`


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
